## Difference between original(1.0.0) and this branch(1.0.2)

 Support     : ubuntu 16.04 or later

 unsupported : ubuntu 14.04/12.04

- Versions used in this release:
-  GCC           5.4.0
-  OpenSSL       1.0.2g
-  Berkeley DB   4.8.30.NC
-  Boost         1.58
-  miniupnpc     1.9

The default BerkeleyDB on Ubuntu 16.04 is Ver 5.1.

BerkeleyDB 4.8 and 5.1 are incompatible.
So,you must install BerkeleyDB 4.8 manually.

## How to install 1.0.2 to ubuntu 16.04

### Build requirements:

	sudo apt-get install build-essential
	sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
	sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

 db4.8 packages are available [here](https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/bitcoin).

 Ubuntu precise has packages for libdb5.1-dev and libdb5.1++-dev,
 but using these will break binary wallet compatibility, and is not recommended.

	sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev
	sudo apt-get install libdb4.8++-dev

### Optional:

	sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev (see USE_UPNP compile flag)

### Berkeley DB:
You need Berkeley DB 4.8.  If you have to build Berkeley DB yourself:

	wget http://download.oracle.com/berkeley-db/db-4.8.30.tar.gz
	tar zxvf db-4.8.30.tar.gz
	cd db-4.8.30.tar/build_unix/    
 	../dist/configure --prefix=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.8 --enable-compat185 --enable-cxx
	sudo make
	sudo make install

### To Build:

	cd src/
	make -f makefile.unix		# Headless bunnycoin

See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building Bunnycoin-Qt, the graphical user interface.
